# Privacy Policy
**Last updated: 14/11/2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how the Brottoli Discord bot (“Service”) handles data.  
Brottoli is open-source and may be self-hosted. This policy applies only to the **hosted** version.

# 1. Summary
- We **do not collect personal data**.  
- We only process **publicly available Discord data** required for bot functionality.  
- We do not sell, trade, or share user information.  
- We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and similar privacy laws.

# 2. Data We Process
The hosted bot processes the following **publicly available Discord data**:

- Server IDs  
- Channel IDs  
- User IDs  
- Usernames and nicknames  
- Commands sent to the bot  
- Message content *only when required for a feature*, processed transiently  
- Server configuration/settings

We do **not** intentionally store or log:
- Email addresses

- Sensitive personal information  

Self-hosted instances may log more, depending on your setup.  
We do **not** receive data from self-hosted instances.

# 3. Why We Process Data
We process minimal Discord data only to:

- Execute commands  
- Store server configuration  
- Maintain required bot functionality  
- Prevent abuse or rate-limit violations  
- Diagnose errors or crashes (logs may contain user IDs)

We do *not* use data for analytics, marketing, profiling, or commercial purposes.

# 4. Data Retention
We store only server configuration and other essential metadata.  
You may request deletion of your server’s stored data at any time.

Temporary logs (if enabled) are automatically cleared periodically.

---

# 5. Data Sharing
We do **not** sell, rent, or trade any data.

Data may be shared only:
- when required by law  
- with Discord, via their API (normal operation)  
- with hosting providers strictly for bot operation  

No third parties receive user information for non-operational purposes.

---

# 6. Security
We implement reasonable security measures to protect stored configuration data.  
No system is perfectly secure.

---

# 7. GDPR Rights (EU Users)
Under GDPR, you have the right to:

- Access stored data (mainly config)  
- Request deletion  
- Request correction  
- Object to processing  
- Stop using the Service at any time  

We act as a **data processor** of publicly available Discord data.

Under CCPA:

- We **do not sell** personal information  
- We collect only publicly available Discord information  
- You may request deletion of stored server configuration
